# ccm — Claude Code account manager

Unlimited named accounts for Claude Code. Launching is switching: every profile is an
isolated `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`, so any number of accounts can run **at the same time**
in different terminals — no swap step, no shared mutable state to corrupt.

The interface is a **split-flap departure board** (think Solari airport board): your
accounts are rows, quota windows are tile meters with amber reset clocks, and cells
flip and settle when data changes. It ships twice — as a full-screen terminal app
(`ccm`) and as a local web page (`ccm ui`) that launches accounts into Windows
Terminal tabs.

```
ccm                     pinned account here? launch it — otherwise the account board:
                        pick an account (sorted by headroom), jump to departures
                        (sessions to resume/transfer), run doctor — all in one screen
ccm ui                  the same board in your browser (local only, 127.0.0.1)
ccm work                launch Claude Code on the "work" account directly
ccm work --resume       extra args pass straight through to claude
ccm status              quota dashboard for every account (plain output)
```

## Install

```powershell
cd path\to\ccm
npm install -g .
```

Requires Node 18+ and Claude Code on PATH. Zero dependencies.

## Getting started

```powershell
ccm import work        # adopt your current ~/.claude login as profile "work"
ccm add personal       # opens Claude Code once — log in with the second account, then /exit
ccm list
```

Your `~/.claude` and the plain `claude` command are never touched — `ccm` is purely additive.

## Commands

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `ccm` | Launches the pinned account for this folder, or shows the arrow-key picker |
| `ccm <name> [args…]` | Launch that account; args pass through to `claude` |
| `ccm pick` | Force the picker (ignores any pin) |
| `ccm import [name]` | Adopt the current `~/.claude` login as a profile, including session history so `--resume` sees past conversations (`--no-history` to skip) |
| `ccm add <name>` | New profile + first login |
| `ccm list` | Profiles at a glance (email, plan, running/last-used) |
| `ccm remove <name>` | Delete a profile (confirms; refuses if running) |
| `ccm status [--fresh\|--json]` | Usage bars, reset times, severity for every account |
| `ccm move-session <to> [id]` | Copy the latest session for this folder (or a given id) to another account and resume it there — the original stays put (`--no-launch` to skip launching) |
| `ccm override <name> [key=value…]` | Per-profile settings merged over the shared layer at launch (e.g. `model=opus theme=dark env.FOO=1`); `--unset key`, `--clear`. `~/.ccm/overrides/<name>.CLAUDE.md` is appended to the shared CLAUDE.md the same way |
| `ccm mcp list / share <name> / unshare <name>` | Shared MCP servers are injected into every profile; servers a profile adds itself always win and are never touched |
| `ccm doctor` | Health check: claude binary, tokens, junctions (auto-repairs), stale locks, integrations |
| `ccm notify on\|off\|test` | Windows toasts on crossing 80%/95% of any limit and when a limit resets ("fresh again") |
| `ccm wt install` | One Windows Terminal profile per account with colored tabs (via WT fragments; auto-synced on add/remove) |
| `ccm pin <name>` / `ccm unpin` | This folder (and subfolders) always uses that account |
| `ccm statusline install` | Show `● work · 5h 43% · wk 12%` inside Claude Code's statusline — and a `→ ccm move-session <best>` hint when you near a limit and another account has headroom |

## How it works

```
~/.ccm/
  config.json            profile registry
  cache/usage.json       cached quota data
  profiles/<name>/       a full CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR: credentials, sessions, history
  shared/                settings.json, CLAUDE.md, agents/, skills/, commands/, hooks/
```

- **Shared config**: directories are junction-linked into every profile (no admin needed
  on Windows); `settings.json` / `CLAUDE.md` / MCP servers are *composed* into each
  profile at launch: shared base + per-profile overrides from `~/.ccm/overrides/`.
  A newer-mtime rule means changes made inside a session (`/config`) survive until the
  shared or override sources actually change. Configure once, override per account.
- **Quota-aware picker**: accounts are listed most-headroom-first with a ✦ marker, so
  picking the account with room is the default gesture — switching stays your choice.
- **Quota data** comes from the same undocumented OAuth usage endpoint Claude Code's own
  `/usage` uses. If Anthropic changes it, only the quota columns degrade.
- **Pinning**: `ccm pin work` writes a `.ccmrc` file; `ccm` walks up from the current
  folder and auto-launches the nearest pin.
- **No auto-rotation**: ccm deliberately does not auto-switch accounts when quota runs
  out — rotating accounts to evade rate limits is against Anthropic's ToS. Switching is
  always your explicit choice.
